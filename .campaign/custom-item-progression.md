## Baselines

**Flare Bolt**, minor gift (fire aspect)  
**Activate** (2 actions).
**Effect** A bolt of flames scorches out from the relic.
Make a spell attach roll with your relic against a target within 30 feet.
The bolt deals 1d6 fire damage for every 2 levels the relic has (minimum 1d6).  
**Critical Success**: The bolt deals double damage, as well as persistent fire damage equal to the level of the relic.  
**Success**: The bolt deals full damage.

**Deadly Spark**, minor gift (air aspect)  
**Activate** (2 actions).
**Effect** A spark flashes out from the relic toward a creature within 20 feet.
This spark deals 1d12 electricity damage (basic Reflex save).
The damage increases by 1d12 at 6th level and by another 1d12 every 4 levels thereafter.

**Runes as Aspect Gifts: Returning rune**, equivalent to minor gift (earth aspect), (3rd level 55 gp)

**Retribution Axe** (3rd level, 60 gp)

The blade of this *+1 greataxe* bears a design of a human skull.
Whenever a creature damages you with an attack, the skull changes its appearance to look like the face of that creature.
You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your next damage roll against that creature before the end of your next turn.
Because the face reshapes each time you're damaged, you get the additional damage only if you attack the creature that damaged you most recently.

## Greataxe

### Aspect of Fury

**Vindictive Strike** (minor gift) (1st level, 20 gp)
The blade of this greataxe shimmers with the thirst for vengeance and gives its wielder a single-minded clarity and focus to retaliate.
Whenever a creature damages you, the metal blade takes on a reddish hue.
You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll against that creature.
You only gain this bonus if you attack the creature that damaged you most recently.

**Relentless Momentum** (minor gift) (1st level, 15 gp)
The blade of this greataxe crackles with the rage of its wielder and gains a vicious momentum when swung.
This weapon gains the Forceful trait.

## Trident

### Aspect of Gozreh

**Weapon of the Sea** (minor gift) (1st level, 15 gp)

This trident, usually engraved with a decorative pattern resembling fish scales, is blessed with the will of Gozreh.
When fighting with this weapon underwater, not having a swim speed no longer causes you to be off-guard.  
**Activate&mdash;Fluid Length** (one action, manipulate)
**Effect** You extend or shorten the trident's haft.
When extended, the trident requires two hands to wield and gains the reach trait, but loses the trident's normal thrown trait.

See Fighter's Fork, *GMC* 242; 3rd level, 50 gp  
**+1 weapon**: 2nd level, 35 gp  
From the difference, **Fluid Length** ability: 15 gp (or 1st level)

**Surging Current** (minor gift) (1st level, 20 gp)

Water collects at the head of the trident.
You can use an Interact action to dip the trident in water to collect up to a gallon (8 pints) of water that floats in a bubble around around the head of the trident.
The water flows in a manner that offers no resistance and seems weightless to you as you wield the trident, but has weight and resistance to other creatures.
When you have collected water, you can use an Interact action to pour any amount of this water from the trident or Dismiss this water to release all of it at once.
All collected water is released when you no longer wield the weapon.  
**Activate&mdash;Surging Current** (two actions, manipulate)
**Effect** When you have water collected at the head of the trident, you can expend a gallon of water to make it to surge forward in a 20 ft line, dealing 2d4 bludgeoning damage with a Reflex save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target takes half damage.  
**Failure** The target takes full damage and is knocked prone.  
**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage, is knocked prone, and, if it is no bigger than Large, is knocked backwards to an unoccupied space that is nearest to the far end of the line.

At 3rd level, and every two levels the trident gains thereafter, increase the damage by 1d4.

## Grimoire
