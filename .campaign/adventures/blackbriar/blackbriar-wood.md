# Blackbriar Wood

Located to the north of Hazelburn, Blackbriar is a wood with a dense undergrowth.
Some paths have been cut into the wood for forestry.
Townsfolk frequently log at the wood.
The deeper parts of the wood are much more difficult to navigate compared to the areas close to the edge and the riverbank.

Thus wood is home to a variety of denizens, including fey who have settled here, and really rich flora.


Blackbriar Wood is a dungeon with three entrances along its southern edge:
from the east near the old logging site,
from the middle following a small stream, and
from the west near the upper bank campsite.

## Old Logging Site

This is where Dargaroth last saw Seraphiel.
This is the site of a former logging operation.
A lot of trees have been cleared.
In one section, there are mostly tree stumps.
In another section, saplings have been planted to manage new growth.

## Twigjack Nest

This is a nest on the edge of the woods of various maladjusted fey creatures that inhabit the wood.

** Rewards**

## Blood-Soaked Path

As the stream meanders through the wood, the ground squelches uncomfortably underfoot.
The soil appears to be a deep brown, and oozes a reddish-brown liquid.

### Encounter 1

There is a dead body of one of the Listener acolytes from the library.
There are clear signs of murder.
Investigating the body gives the following information:

- This was one of the Listeners; his effects are missing and there is no immediate way of identifying him.
- The cause of death was several blows struck by a heavy, bladed weapon.
  His bones seem to have also broken from the force of the blow.
- The body was hidden here very deliberately.
  Someone tried to cover their tracks.
- There is a concealed pocket in the sleeves of his robe for hiding something secret.
  The is empty, albeit undisturbed, suggesting the assailant did not find what was concealed here, but that it must have been hidden by the acolyte separately.

Relevant checks to investigate:

- Society, Religion, or Occultism to glean information about the acolyte,
- Medicine to examine the body,
- Survival to track where the body was dragged from and to find other footsteps,
- Perception to find concealed items.

Tracing the footsteps reveals where the struggle took place, as well as where the acolyte hid their effects.
There are other footprints in the hiding spot that seem to be heading further down the riverbank.

### Encounter 2

#### Blood-Soaked Soil (3)

**Complexity** Complex  
**Stealth** DC 16 (trained) to smell blood  
**Description** The blood that squelches up from the ground seethes into a bloody morass.

<hr />

**Disable** DC 18 Nature or Occultism (trained) to settle the spirits of the dead or DC 19 Religion (trained) to bless the area  
**Seep Blood** (Reaction)
**Trigger** A creature enters the area.
**Effect** Blood seeps up from the earth, turning the area into sucking, gory mud.
The area becomes difficult terrain for 1 hour or until the hazard is disabled.
All creatures in or moving through the area must succeed at a DC 18 Reflex save, or they sink into the mud up to their shins and they become immobilised until they can Escape (DC 18) or are freed by another creature by succeeding a DC 18 Athletics check.
If a creature critically fails a check to free another creature, it also gets immobilised by the mud.
The blood-soaked soil then rolls initiative if it hasn't already.

**Routine** (1 action)
On its initiative, the blood-soaked oozes gouts of blood that burn the skin and flesh of those caught in the spray, dealing 2d6 Void damage.
All creatures in the area must attempt a DC 16 Fort save (creatures immobilised by the blood-soaked soil take a -2 circumstance penalty to the save).

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target takes half damage.  
**Failure** The target takes full damage, and its Speeds are reduced by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5) for 1 round.  
**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage, and its speeds are reduced by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5) for 1 minute.

### Encounter 1

- The merchant selling wares has a pouch on the table that bears the insignia of the Listeners.
