??? Abstract "Building the Timeline"

    This timeline was created using [Ben Robbins' *Microscope*](../meta/about.md#microscope), a fractal timeline-building RPG we used to build the history and lore of our sandbox setting.
    This timeline includes the different Periods and Events from our history (and omits individual scenes).
    Additionally, *Microscope* divides elements of its timeline into 'light' and 'dark', two broad categories that reflect the overall tone of the object.
