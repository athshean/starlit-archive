## The Era of Legend 

The Era of Legend is a long-forgotten span of our history.
It was defined by the Great Wars of the Gods.
In a time of great strife and tumult, our Earth was adrift across the turbulent sea of the cosmos.
Just like the Gods, our Earth's many peoples also fought in endless conflicts in response to the many cataclysms that were wrought upon the world.

The Era spans several periods across history.
Knowledge of it in the [Whispers](../starlit-abyss.md#the-whispers) is sparse and often conflicting.
Compiled here are whatever coherent, corroborated fragments that could be distilled from these many different accounts.

This timeline is a loose visual representation of the Era and its many constituent Ages.
Boundaries between the ages is the subject of considerable historiographical dispute, as are the chronology of events and their significance within the wider history.
