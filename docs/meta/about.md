# About the Campaign

This campaign primarily uses the *Pathfinder Second Edition* rule set.
Our group also incorporates other indie games as the need arises.

## :material-compass: Pathfinder

The campaign uses the *Pathfinder Second Edition* rule set published by Paizo Inc,
specifically, the Remastered version of the rules re-published under the ORC License.
This includes the following core source books:

- *Player Core* (PC)
- *Player Core 2* (PC2)
- *GM Core* (GMC)
- *Monster Core* (MC)

This campaign draws from published *Pathfinder* materials for some elements of lore, such as lists of deities directly linked with character creation options, monsters or characters from the various bestiaries, or specific settings or locations.
The approach we use is one of an open sandbox where we sometimes bring in items from canonical *Pathfinder* materials to further flesh out the world.

Where Remastered material hasn't yet superseded previously published items, and there is a need for more game resources or subsystems, the campaign may occasionally draw from other source books.

## :material-microscope: Microscope

We are using an open sandbox world for the campaign.
In order to flesh out the lore and history of this world, we played [*Microscope* by Ben Robbins :material-open-in-new:](https://lamemage.com/microscope/){:target="_blank"}.

*Microscope* is a fractal timeline-building RPG where players co-create a fictional history across vast swathes of time, while also zooming in to explore themes and resonances across specific events and scenes.
*Microscope* is one of the most engaging and delightful games I have played, and it features prominently in my toolkit for campaigns I run.
It is an invaluable resource for building the lore for a campaign.

***Microscope* as a side game**:  
If we do not have a full party, and if someone cannot make our usual sessions, we play *Microscope* instead to continue building the lore world even if we do not advance the main campaign.
