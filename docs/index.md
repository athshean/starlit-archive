# Welcome to the Starlit Archive

<span class="text-archive-title">The Starlit Archive</span> is an encyclopaedia that chronicles the **Whispers of the Starlit Abyss**.
It assembles fragments of knowledge from across the Era of Legend.

<span class="text-archive-title">The Archive</span> is compiled by the Listeners, acolytes who strive to preserve these Whispers.
We hope that these fragmentary echoes will someday harmonise into a great choir of wisdom from the Ages.
    
!!! Abstract "Reading <span class="text-archive-title">the Archive</span>"

    This is a record of history and lore for a *Pathfinder 2e* campaign I am running.
    The setting and world are an open sandbox where everyone at the table is co-creating the lore.
    This site compiles what we have made so far.

    Except where stated otherwise, information here is presented **intradiegetically** from the perspective of a nameless collective of authors.
    Exceptions to this are pages with the [<span class='no-wrap'>:material-tag-text: Meta</span>](./tags/index.md#meta) tag.
    
    **Extradiegetic information** is presented in blue boxes like this with the <span class='no-wrap'>{== :material-script-text-key: icon ==}</span>.
    Where necessary, these asides provide game information to contextualise the adjoining information, such as providing external commentary or referencing where we adapt or alter officially published *Pathfinder* material.

    For more information about the campaign, see the [<span class='no-wrap'>:material-map-legend: About the Campaign</span>](meta/about.md) section.
