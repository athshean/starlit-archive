# The Starlit Archive

This site is an encyclopaedia of lore for a *Pathfinder Second Edition* campaign I am running.
It compiles all the background history and information to serve as a reference for the campaign.
The encyclopaedia is written from an intradiegetic perspective, although some pages and asides give metacommentary about game elements.

This site is built using MKDocs, a static site generator designed for API documentation, and hosted on GitHub Pages.
I am using MKDocs because it is written in Python and it is a framework with which I am already familiar.
Its theming and layout look good and are customisable enough to give this encyclopaedia enough styling.
It is also fairly simple and intuitive to write and structure the content using folders and Markdown files.

I chose a static site generator because, in all likelihood, I will be the only one editing and compiling the encyclopaedia.
It doesn't need to be editable by multiple authors as a wiki normally would.
It will also be hosting information that is fairly static.

Additionally, a static site can be hosted on GitHub Pages.
Not only does this provide a free site to host the encyclopaedia, but using Git to deploy the site means I have precise version control.
